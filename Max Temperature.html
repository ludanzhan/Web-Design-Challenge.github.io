                        As expected, the weather becomes significantly warmer as one approached
                        the equator(0 Deg. Latitude). More interestingly, however, is the fact that
                        the southern hemisphere tends to be warmer this time of year than northern hemisphere.
                        This may be due to the tilt of the earth at the time of the year this data was gathered.
