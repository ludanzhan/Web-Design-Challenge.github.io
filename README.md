# Visulize Data with Website Dashborad
For this project, I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I've created in a past assignment. In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which I can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where I can view the data used to build them.

## Bootstrap
In this project, I used **Bootstrap** to help with styling and creating website content, specifically for creating NavBar and responsive NavBar.
